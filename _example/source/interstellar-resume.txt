Interstellar is a 2014 science fiction film about a former NASA pilot who leads a mission to find a new planet for humans to inhabit:

Setting
  The film is set in the mid-21st century, when Earth is becoming uninhabitable due to crop blights and dust storms.

Characters
  The main character is Joseph Cooper, a former NASA pilot who becomes a farmer and raises his children with his father-in-law. Other characters include Dr. Brand, a NASA physicist, and Murph and Tom, Cooper's children.

Plot
  Cooper is recruited to pilot a spacecraft through a wormhole to find a new planet. The wormhole is a hypothetical "bridge" that connects two distant points in the universe by bending space-time.

Themes
  The film explores themes of time, relativity, and the human condition. For example, the astronauts perceive time differently depending on where they are in space, and time on Earth is passing much faster than on some planets in space.

Awards
  Interstellar won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Production Design, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Sound Editing.
